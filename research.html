      <p>Attempts to explain the Brexit referendum result have often focussed on the type of individual to vote for Remain or for Leave, but less attention has been paid to the mechanism by which some individuals were persuaded to change their opinion. In this paper I address whether traditional methods of campaign contact, such as door knocking and phone-calls, affected the likelihood of an individual changing their intented referendum vote.</p>    

      <div class="refs"><a class="intext" href="https://electionsetc.com/2019/12/09/why-are-polls-from-different-pollsters-so-different/" target=blank>Blog Post: Why are polls from different pollsters so different?</a></div> 
  
      <p>Why did the polls differ in their estimation of the Conservative-Labour lead in the run-up to the 2019 UK General Election? By making use of the standard tables (made publicly available by all political pollsters) Steve Fisher and I attempted to identify the reasons for the 'house effects'. Our conclusion was that, among other factors, the differences were heavily due to differences in the original samples.</p>

      <p>In wave 8 of the CSI Brexit panel study, participants were asked to select which politician they trusted from a list we provided, including the main party leaders. The most popular answer by far was ‘None or Other’, showing a substantial lack of trust in political elites among the sample. Theresa May, the then Prime Minister, was the second most frequent answer. Party loyalty was limited, with only Nicola Sturgeon being named as ‘trusted’ by more than 50% of her party’s identifiers. Many respondents demonstrated a lack of knowledge about their trusted politician’s position on Theresa May’s negotiated withdrawal agreement, including a large proportion of those individuals who trusted Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. Nigel Farage, however, appears to have communicated his position very clearly; almost all of those who trusted him knew his opinion.</p>
